## My History

### Currently - Data Scientist

I am a part of data science team at Playpower Labs. We work with various kinds of educational companies, ranging from textbook publishers to digital learning companies. In most of the projects, we work with learner data and build tools and services empower product teams, students, and educators.

### Previously - Post Graduate from DA-IICT

Before you make a guess, I am not from IIT and neither from NIT! I am proud to be a DA-IICTian by heart. This place helped me immensely to grow and take a supercalyfragilisticexpialidocious career path(Machine Intelligence).
